Loony Localizations with Blazor

We want to start building better Blazor websites that allow our international friends who speak languages other than English to participate.  In this example, we followed the instructions to add Localization capabilities to the InteractiveServer website.  The culture gets properly detected, and updates the section at the bottom, but for some reason the translation in the greeting line does not get applied.

What's the problem in our project?
